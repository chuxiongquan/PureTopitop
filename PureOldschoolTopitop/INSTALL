This file describes how to compile and install the 'gamesman' package.  For
more information on what gamesman is, how to use it, or how it works, see the
README file included in this package.


COMPILING INSTRUCTIONS
======================

In order to compile gamesman, You need to have the necessary building tools
and libraries installed. Here is a partial list:

autoconf (latest version)
GNU make (latest version)
gcc, corresponding headers and libraries for C and C++ development
(latest version)

if you are building GUI applications for the games, you will also need:

tcl/tk development headers (version 8.4)
X headers (latest version, xorg-x11-devel should be all you need)

if you want to compile games with big integer support:

The GMP library (latest version)

if you want to compile pygamesman (a python port of gamesman):

Python (version 2.4)

When you have installed all the necessary components, you can generate the
configure script by typing in the gamesman root directory (if it does not
already exist):

% autoconf

then simply type:

% ./configure
% make

This will setup and compile gamesman with the standard set of options.  Note
that if 'make' fails immediately with a message such as:

make: Fatal error in reader: Makefile, line 216: Extra :', ::', or :=' on
dependency line

then you may need to use 'gmake'.  If the problem recurs, then install the
latest version of GNU Make (see http://www.gnu.org/) and try again.


CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
=====================

If the above method of installation does not work due to the idiosyncrasies
of your system, or if you want to change an option such as whether or not to
build with graphics, then you may need to change the configuration options.
For a full list of options, type:

% ./configure --help

And a list of options available to you will be displayed.  To set any of the
options listed, type them after './configure' on the command line.  This is
shown:

% ./configure [option1 [option2 ...]]
eg:
% ./configure --with-aqua --with-tcl=/usr/lib/tclConfig.sh


Here are ones you may need to know about:

  --disable-graphics
    If you do not have Tcl/Tk (see http://www.tcl.tk), and you do not want
    to build gamesman with graphics, then use this option.
  --with-aqua
    If you have a Mac with Mac OS X as well as the macos distribution of
    Tcl/Tk, and you want the Aqua wish shell instead of X11, use this.
    Note: Currently, Aqua wish is plagued with bugs that cause certain
    graphics to not be properly displayed.  The use of Aqua wish is not
    recommended.
  --with-tcl
    If the configure script fails to find the proper tclConfig.sh file, and
    you have tcl installed on your system, then you can tell it explicitly
    the file to find using this option.
  --with-tk
    Same as above, except regards the tkConfig.sh
  --with-wish
    Same as above, except regards the wish shell (usually /usr/bin/wish or
    /usr/local/bin/wish).

If changing the options does not fix the problem, then you should e-mail
someone involved with gamescrafters and describe your situation.


RUNNING GAMESMAN
================

Once gamesman is configured and compiled, you can run it by cd'ing to the
bin/ directory inside of the package and running a file that starts with an
m (such as machi, or mttt), and play the game from the console.  If you are
in an X-Windows environment, you may go to the bin/ directory and type:

% ./XGamesman

to start up the graphical gamesman interface, where you will be presented
with a list of games currently in gamesman, and simply click to play.



Happy gaming!
