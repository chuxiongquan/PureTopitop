<p><b>History</b> 

<p><b>
Rubik's Checkers</b> is a game that is similar to checkers.   The popular Rubik's games were originally invented by Ern&ouml; Rubik. <p>

<p>
<b> Game Play</b>
<hr>
<b>The Board:</b><br> 
The standard Rubik's Checkers board is a variable grid of squares.  

<br>Starting position: A specific number of kings for each player on opposite sides of the board.  

<p><b> The Pieces:</b> <br>
There are two pieces - kings and men.  Kings become men when jumped over by a king.  


<p>
<b> Rules: </b><br>
<b>To move:</b> Each player takes turns making one valid move.  <br>
Valid Moves: <br>
Kings may move diagonally, forward, or backward.  A king may jump over an opponent's piece if the space it jumps to is empty.  Multiple jumps are possible (like in regular checkers).  When a king jumps over an opponent's king, that king is demoted to a man.  If the king jumps over an opponent's man, then that man is removed from the board.  When a player's king jumps over the same player's man, that man is promoted back to a king.  
<br> A man may only move backwards, not forward.  A man cannot jump or capture any piece.  
<br> On your turn, a piece in your home row may be promoted to a King.  


<br><b>To win:</b> Eliminate all of the opponents pieces or prevent them from moving.   

<p>  Players alternate making legal moves.  


<p>
<b>Variants:</b>
<br><b>Misere</b>: Eliminate all of your own pieces or prevent all of your pieces from moving.
