<b> Game Play:</b>
<hr>
<b>The Board:</b><br> The board is either a surface on which to place the pieces or a piece of paper to keep track of everything.
<br>
Starting Position: 15 matches on the board.





<p><b> The Pieces:</b><br> The pieces usually are 15 matches, however, any sort of counter or even numbers written on paper will work.



<p>
<b> Rules: </b><br>
<b>To move:</b> To move: Remove 1, 2, or 3 matches from the board and place them in front of you.



<br><b>To win:</b> Have an even number of matches in front of you when no more matches are on the board.




<p>
Begin with 15 matches on the board. The player who goes first takes 1, 2, or 3 matches off the board. The second player does the same and play alternates until there are no matches left on the board. Whoever has the even number of matches wins.



<p>
<b>Variants:</b>
<br><b>Misere:</b> Whoever has the odd number of matches at the end wins.
<br>
<b>Number of pieces:</b> Any odd number of starting pieces will work.
