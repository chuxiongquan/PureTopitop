<b> Game Play</b>
<hr>
<b>The Board:</b><br> Five by Five square board.  
<p><b> The Pieces:</b><br> Each player can use a different colored pen or pencil to draw lines across the board. 
<p>
<b> Rules: </b><br>
<b>To move:</b> Place a piece on an open space. 
<br><b>To win:</b> To get your own colored pieces to be touching either above or to the side of each other all the way across the board (for one player that means vertically, the other horizontally).
<p>
The players take turns placing their pieces in the open slots until either one player has a connection across the board (that player wins) or until the board is full (resulting in a tie). 

<p>
<b>Variants:</b>
<br><b>Misere:</b> Force your opponent's colored pieces to connect across the board.
