<p><b>History</b> 

<p><b>
Quick Chess</b> was invented by Joe Miccio in 1991 and is a chess variant.   <p>

<p>
<b> Game Play</b>
<hr>
<b>The Board:</b><br> 
The standard Quick Chess board is a 6x5 board of squares.    

<br>Starting position:  One horse, king, queen, rook, bishop, and knight in the back row, and five pawns in front of them; all of one color.  The other color &quot;mirrors&quot; this on the opposite side of the board.  

<p><b> The Pieces:</b> <br>
The pieces consist of the pieces used in chess - king, queen, rook, bishop, knight, and pawn.   


<p>
<b> Rules: </b><br>
<b>To move:</b> Each player takes turns making one valid move.  <br>
Valid Moves: <br>
King - May move to any adjacent square. <br>
Queen - May move in any direction any number of squares. <br>
Rook - May move up, down, left, or right (but not diagonally) any number of squares. <br>
Bishop - May move diagonally any number of squares. <br>
Knight - May move to a space that is two squares and one square to the left/right away, making a L shape.  The knight may jump over pieces when moving.  
Pawn - May move forward one square or may capture a piece by moving diagonally one square (no two square initial moving like in standard chess).  [Note: Pawns may only be promoted to a captured piece]


<br><b>To win:</b> Checkmate the opponent's king.   

<p>  Players alternate making legal moves.  White moves first.  


<p>
<b>Variants:</b>
<br><b>Misere</b>: Get your king checkmated.
