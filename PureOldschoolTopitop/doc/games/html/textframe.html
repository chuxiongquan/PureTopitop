<b>"What part of 'all red?' don't you understand?" </b>
<br>-- Mike Margolis to Dan Garcia, after Dan attempted to beat Gamesman in three-dot even though he had a losing position
(red signifies a losing move, 'all red' signifies that all attempts to win are futile, i.e., all his bases belong to us), Spring 2002.

<p><b>"There once was a prof known as Danny...
<br>who couldn't play games worth a penny.
<br>He wrote a small program...
<br>that played them all fo' him.
<br>Now he indeed seems quite canny!" </b>
<br>-- Daniel Horn, UC Berkeley undergraduate and future Gamesman</font>
