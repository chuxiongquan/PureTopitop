<p><b>History</b> 

<p><b>
Topitop</b> is a wooden game created by Thierry Denoual and is made by BlueOrange Games.   <p>

<p>
<b> Game Play</b>
<hr>
<b>The Board:</b><br> 
The standard Topitop board is a 3x3 grid of squares.  

<br>Starting position: Nothing on the board.  Each player chooses a color and gets 2 buckets of that color.  

<p><b> The Pieces:</b> <br>
There are four different basic pieces in Topitop - red buckets, blue buckets, small sand piles, and large sand piles.  The sand piles belong to any player.  A sand castle or &#34castle piece&#34 can be made by placing a small sand pile on a large sand pile.  A &#34bucket piece&#34 can be made by placing a bucket on a small sand pile.  Lastly, a red/blue sand castle can be made when a bucket is on a castle piece.  Only buckets and pieces with a specific color bucket on it are in control of the respective player.  


<p>
<b> Rules: </b><br>
<b>To move:</b> Each player takes turns making one valid move and CANNOT reverse the opponent's move that was just made.  <br>
Valid Moves: <br>
1) Place one of your buckets or one of the small or large sand piles on any free space on the board <br>
2) Move one of your buckets or any small or large sand pile already placed on the board from one square to another (one space at any time in any direction) <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  a) Any piece already on the board can be moved to an adjacent free space.  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  b) A bucket can go on top of a small sand pile.  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  c) A small sand pile can go on top of a large sand pile. <br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;  d) A small sand pile with a bucket on its top can go on top of a large sand pile. <br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;  e) A bucket can go on top of a sand castle.  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  NOTE: You CANNOT place a piece on top of another piece (from off the board to on top of a piece already on the board).  Pieces must be MOVED on top of other pieces<br>
3) Move any combination of sand piles with your buckets on top, or any sand castle, to any free space.  


<br><b>To win:</b> Be the first player to have two buckets on top of two sand castles (small sand pile on large sand pile).  

<p> Whoever is blue goes first.  The players alternate making legal moves.  Whenever a player cannot make a legal move, he or she passes the turn to the other player.  


<p>
<b>Variants:</b>
<br><b>Misere</b>: Force the opponent to form two red/blue sand castles.
