<b> Game Play</b>
<hr>
<b>The Board:</b>
<br> Honeycomb shaped board that starts with 3 spaces on top, five in the middle and 3 on the bottom of the board. 
<p><b> The Pieces:</b> <br>Each player has 10 stones of his color plus 10 neutral pieces. 
<p>
<b> Rules: </b><br>
<b>To move:</b> Place either a checker onto an empty position or a winker on top of a checker as long as you
have a piece of that type. You may also pass
<br><b>To win:</b> To get three in a row either vertically, horizontally or diagonally.<p>
Players alternate turns placing a piece on the board. On the player's turn they may either place a neutral piece on an empty spot or they 
may put a stone of their color on top of a neutral piece. The player is also able to pass if they are not able to legally place a piece. 
The first person to get three in a row of their color wins. If, however, they use up all their stones without managing a win, the player loses.
