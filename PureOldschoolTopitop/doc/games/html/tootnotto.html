<p><b>History</b> 

<p><b>
Toot and Otto</b> is a game similar to Connect 4 made by ThinkFun.  <p>

<p>
<b> Game Play</b>
<hr>
<b>The Board:</b><br> 
The standard Toot and Otto board is 6x4, and the version in the games database can grow up to a 7x7 board.  

<br>Starting position: Nothing on the board.  Each player chooses a name (either &#34Toot&#34 or &#34Otto&#34).      

<p><b> The Pieces:</b> <br>
There are two pieces in Toot and Otto - the T and the O.  Each player has a limited number of each letter.  


<p>
<b> Rules: </b><br>
<b>To move:</b> Each player takes turns making one valid move.  <br>
Valid Moves: <br>
On your turn, place a piece down one of the columns.  A piece cannot be played on a column that is full (all its rows are filled).  


<br><b>To win:</b> Be the first player to get your name, either &#34TOOT&#34 or &#34OTTO&#34 depending on which player you are, spelled on the board vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.  


<p> Toot goes first and players alternate making legal moves. 


<p>
<b>Variants:</b>
<br><b>Misere</b>: Force the opponent to spell his or her name.  A player loses if his or her name is spelled.
