<p><b>History</b> 

<p><b>
Tile Chess</b> is a chess variant that was made by Jason Wittman during the late 80's as part of a project for his art class.  This game is a cross between chess and dominoes.  <p>

<p>
<b> Game Play</b>
<hr>
<b>The Board:</b><br> 
The standard Tile Chess board is infinitely big.  

<br>Starting position: Nothing on the board.  Each player chooses a color and begins placing pieces down, one at a time, taking turns to do so.  The pieces must be connected to each other (either adjacent to a piece of your color or an opponent's).  

<p><b> The Pieces:</b> <br>
There are 16 tiles for each color (player) and consists of all chess pieces (king, rook, queen, pawn, bishop, and knight).  


<p>
<b> Rules: </b><br>
<b>To move:</b> Each player takes turns making one valid move.  <br>
Valid Moves: <br>
All pieces move in the same was as regular chess, with a few exceptions.  You may jump over your own pieces with pieces other than the knight.  Pawns can move, as well as capture, forwards and backwards.  In addition, you cannot capture a piece and make an island (a piece that is not connect to the main link of pieces).  


<br><b>To win:</b> Checkmate the opponent's king.  If playing with more than 2 players, then when one player is checkmated by you, you gain control of his or her tiles.  


<p>
<b>Variants:</b>
<br><b>Misere</b>: Try to get your own king checkmated.
