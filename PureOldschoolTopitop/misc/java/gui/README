This file is now out of date.  I will write this up on the wiki, eventually...

This file will describe the current format of the xml file describing a game.  The system currently only supports grid-style boards, like Achi or Othello.  Support for hexagonal and custom board shapes, such as the boards in Sim and Mancala, will be added in the future.  


Of course, the XML file needs to be properly formed; tags need to be closed, etc.


<game><info><name>
	This is the first section in most files.  It contains the human-readable name for this game.

<game><info><dbname>
	This contains the db name that identifies this game to the Gamesman system.  This name is used to load the shared libraries containing the game code.  


<game><board><type>
	Currently this must contain the string "grid".  When other board types are added, they will be specified here.

<game><board><width>
	This contains the default board width.  This needs to be the same value as in the C code.

<game><board><height>
	This contains the default board height.  This needs to be the same value as in the C code.

<game><board><bgcolor>
	This contains, in hexadecimal, the base color for the board.  This value must be a hexadecimal number, so black would be the value "000000" and white would be "ffffff".  Any six-digit or less hexadecimal number can be used here.


<game><hash>
	This informs the GUI which hash to use.  This value must be either "generic" or "custom".  If the game uses the generic hash functions, use the value "generic".  If you use your own hash function, you must set gCustomUnhash and set this to "custom".  If you do not set this correctly, the GUI will crash will some very strange error messages.


<game><pieces>
	This contains descriptions of the pieces used in this game.  Each piece is in its own section.

<game><pieces><piece>
	This section contains the description of one piece.  All subfields must be present.  If they are not present, the behavior of the GUI is at this time unspecified.

<game><pieces><piece><charID>
	This contains the character used to denote this piece in the unhashed string representing the board.  It _must_ be either a single character or the literal string "space" to denote a space (' ').

<game><pieces><piece><shape>
	The value of this field must be one of several literal strings: "circle", "X", "O", "empty", or "custom".  Custom functionality has not beed added as this time.  This piece will be displayed using this shape on the board, either a filled circle, an X, an O, or an empty field.

<game><pieces><piece><color>
	This six-digit hexadecimal number identifies the color used when painting this piece.  See <game><board><color> for a description of the format required.


<game><movetypes>
	This section is currently unused.  It should contain the kinds of moves required in this game for use in the move parser.  For example, the only move type in Othello is dartboard-style move.  In Achi, however, there are both sliding moves and placement moves.  This section is definitely a work in progress, and will probably not be used until we can rewrite the pattern matcher.

<game><variants>
	This section is also currently unused.  In the future, it will describe the variants used in this game, how to present the choices to the user and how to communicate with the C module in question.  The best format for this section as as of yet undetermined.
